# Tobias
Tobias is a Personal Assistant that can do many things. Being built on there are 4 phases. Phase 1 is raw and basic implementations.
Phase 2 is to fix small errors, add more features, make more realistic and more user friendly
Phase 3 is optimization, Deep learning and cleaning up the code
Phase 4 and final phase. If I make it here I hope to give credit to other people and able to create a killer Virtual Assistant.

## Setup
Tobias requires several python packages, but not all are needed. Running `setup.py` will walk through setting up the necessary python requirements and some configuration variables.
